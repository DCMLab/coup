## Correction of obvious mistakes (Aug 7th)

### Based on rare bass degrees

**5 occurrences of `bb3`**

Corrected by replacing incorrect `vi` (in minor) by `#vi` in `c08n02_ritournele` mm. 11, 17, 43, 51 and `c08n10_air_lentement` m. 38. In the first four mentioned cases, each subsequent `vii` needed correction to `#vii`, too, which could hint at a systematic error in minor segments. If the 'normal' `2` is written as `viio6` instead of `#viio6`, the bass degree will turn out wrongly as `b2`.

**11 remaining occurrences of `b2`**

As suspected above, `vii` had to replaced by `#vii` in:

* `c03n03_courante`, m. 74+
* `c07n03_sarabande`, m. 30
* `c10n03_plainte`, m. 24
* `c11n01_majestueusement`, m. 36
* `c11n02_allemande`, m. 21
* `c11n03_seconde_allemande`, m. 15
* `c14n01_gravement`, m. 6
* `c14n04_fuguete`, m. 38
* `parnasse_07`, m. 44 (and in m. 39 `vi/iv` was corrected to `#vi/iv`)

Here, `vii` was actually `ii`:

* `c03n02_allemande`, m. 8

**7 occurrences of `b4`**

Once more, the reason are `viio` chords in minor contexts.

* `c01n06_menuet_en_trio`, m. 4
* `c05n05_musete`, m. 38
* `c07n04_fuguete`, mm. 11 & 16
* `c07n06_siciliene`, m. 16

Here, `bII` was written as minor triad `bii`:

* `c10n01_gravement`, m. 12

**2 occurrences of `b1`**

Another two cases where `vi` was actually `#vi` in minor.

* `c07n03_sarabande`, m. 32
* `c14n01_gravement`, m. 9

**2 occurrences of `b5`**

* `c03n03_courante`, m. 1: `VI2` => `VIM2` in minor
* `c08n10_air_lentement`, m. 37: `vi` => `#vi` in minor

**1 occurrence of `bb7`**

`parnasse_07`, m. 16 had `vii/iv` instead of `#vii/iv`.

### Based on rare intervals between bass notes

**2 occurrences of 10 (-D3)**

* `c14n03_sarabande` m. 15: the B minor chord, within D minor, needs to be written as `#vi`
* `c03n08_chaconne_legere` m. 4: was missing the key change back to `i`

**occurrences of -9 (-A2)**

* `c02n01_prelude` m. 12: `ii%` was corrected to `iii%`
